## Getting Started

[Flutterfire docs](https://firebase.flutter.dev/docs/messaging/overview)

### iOS

Firebase Messaging plugin will not work if you disable method swizzling. Please remove or set to true the FirebaseAppDelegateProxyEnabled in your Info.plist file if it exists.
```

- [FCM via APNs Integration](https://firebase.flutter.dev/docs/messaging/apple-integration/)


- [Allow images on notifications](https://firebase.flutter.dev/docs/messaging/apple-integration/#advanced-optional-allowing-notification-images)

```
Your device can now display images in a notification by specifying the `imageUrl` option in your FCM payload. Keep in mind that a 300KB max image size is enforced by the device.
